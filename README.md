Small class project in using CSS to get page to match design comp

Skillcrush provided the index.html, images, a design comp of what it should look like, 
and led us through creating and fine-tuning the css. I fine-tuned the css. 
When I get the chance, I plan to do this over again with some of my own recipes, and change the 
formatting to make it my own.
